## 🧠 About Me

I am an applied mathematics undergraduate passionate about leveraging **mathematical modeling, stochastic processes, and machine learning** to solve complex biological and real-world problems.

My long-term goal is to pursue an **MS/PhD in Applied Mathematics**, focusing on mathematical oncology, computational biology, and AI-integrated modeling systems.

I believe mathematics is not just theoretical elegance — it is a predictive engine for life sciences, economics, and intelligent systems.
